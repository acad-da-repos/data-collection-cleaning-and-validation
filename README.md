# Data Collection, Cleaning, and Validation Assignment

## Problem Description

In this assignment, you will work on cleaning and validating a dataset. This is a critical step in any data analysis project to ensure the quality and accuracy of your data.

## Instructions

1.  Open the `assignment.py` file.
2.  You will find a function definition: `clean_and_validate_data(df)`.
3.  Your task is to perform the following operations on the input DataFrame `df`:
    *   Remove duplicate rows.
    *   Handle missing values in the 'Age' column by filling them with the mean age.
    *   Validate the 'Email' column to ensure it contains a valid email format.
4.  The function should return the cleaned and validated DataFrame.

## Further Exploration (Optional)

*   What are other strategies for handling missing data?
*   How can you use regular expressions to perform more complex email validation?
*   Explore other data validation libraries in Python, such as `Cerberus` or `Great Expectations`.
